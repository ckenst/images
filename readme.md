# Images Catalog

The goal is to create a comprehensive catalog of images for testing based on a number of variables including size, format (file extension) and image complexity. At this point this repo is just starting out and is organized by file size.

Images were either created by me or I found them on the web. Trying to use creative commons / free licenses. For any complaints please open an issue.

For submissions, please create PRs.

- Size: Not sure if we can find anything larger than ~500MB
- [Type / file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_file_formats)
  - Add: .raw
  - Add: .gif
  - Add: .ico
  - Add: .svg
  - Any other proprietary image file types?
- Complexity (color, etc.)
  - ~~B&W + Color have been added~~
  - Compressed?

TODO:
- Eventually create a page just like http://gifs.joelglovier.com/.
- Add more instructions on how to commit
- How do we attribute ownership of images?
- Separate images into respective folders (based on what?)
- Look at this: http://www.math.purdue.edu/~lucier/692/test_images.html
- Look at this: http://www.colorwiki.com/wiki/Test_Images
- All photos should be listed under what license?
