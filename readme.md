# Images Catalog

The goal is to create a comprehensive catalog of images for testing based on a number of variables including size, format (file extension) and image complexity. At this point this repo is just starting out and is organized by file size.

Images were either created by me or found them on the web. Trying to use creative commons / free licenses. For any complaints please open an issue.

For submissions, please create PRs.
